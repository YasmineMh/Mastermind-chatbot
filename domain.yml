  utter_game_rules:
  - text: "This game is similar to MasterMind Game which is a number game. 
  I will select a secret number with four different (unique) digits. 
  The object of the game is to guess that secret number. 
  Each guess is answered by the number of digits in the guess number that match or occur in the secret number. 
  You will also be told how many of the digits are in the correct position in the chosen number. 
  Through a process of elimination, you should be able to deduce the correct digits using logic."

  utter_example:
  - text: "If I chose 1234 number and you enter 7438, I will tell you those infomations: 1 CP and 1 IP.
  Explanation: The number contains one digit in a correct position (CP) which is the digit 3 AND one digit but in an incorrect position (IP) which is the digit 4"
